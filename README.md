# Lagos-Flood-Prediction-Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a flood prediction model for Lagos, Nigeria, using historical weather data. The primary goal is to enhance flood risk management and disaster preparedness by accurately predicting flood occurrences based on key weather indicators.

## Key Features
Data Sources: The project utilizes historical weather data, including precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and moon phases.

Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing of the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between weather variables and flood occurrences.

Correlation Analysis: A detailed correlation heatmap to identify the most significant predictors of flooding.

Model Development: Implementation of machine learning models to predict flood occurrences based on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation: Assessment of model accuracy and reliability, addressing challenges such as data imbalance.

## Results
The flood prediction model developed in this project demonstrates acceptable accuracy and reliability. Key findings include:

Significant Predictors: Precipitation, humidity, and cloud cover show strong correlations with flood occurrences, making them crucial for prediction.

Model Performance: The model effectively captures the relationships between these variables and flood events, providing valuable insights for flood risk management.

## Conclusion
This project successfully developed a flood prediction model for Lagos, Nigeria, leveraging historical weather data. Despite challenges such as data imbalance, the model's predictions can significantly enhance flood risk management and disaster preparedness in the region.
